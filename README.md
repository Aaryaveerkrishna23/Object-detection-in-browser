TensorFlow.js Skeleton
=================

This very simple skeleton simply loads in TensorFlow.js and prints out the version once loaded to the DOM.

From these humble beginnings you can do some really great things. 

Feel free to fork this and use it as a quick way to start coding with TensorFlow.js.


Your Project
------------

### ← index.html

We simply have a script tag in our HTML to grab the latest version of TensorFlow.js


### ← script.js

This simply grabs a reference to a paragraph in the DOM and then prints out the TensorFlow.js version number to it once it is loaded.
